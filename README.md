# Weather-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This  project  involves working on a data set by data collection and processing and cleaning, applying linear regression and stepwise regression on the processed data using stats models and Python libraries, then using the Tensor Flowâ€™s High-Level Estimator API and finally building a DNN Regressor to predict weather.
